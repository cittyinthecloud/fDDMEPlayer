Downloading straight this repository will cause you to end up with a in-development version of the launcher, where bugs will be more likely to occur. 

A mod launcher for DDLC.

To run this you will need Python 3, which you can get from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

Make sure you check the Add Python to PATH box on Windows

After that, place a copy of DDLC from download into this app's folder, and rename it to DDLC

Then run setup.bat to setup the app

After running this app, you will need to open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to access the launcher.
